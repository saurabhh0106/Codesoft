### 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the disaster. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin information.

### 🔍 Key Features
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in survival rates
* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering)
* Model selection and evaluation using classification algorithms
* Performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
