### This project utilizes the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning, to build a classification model that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
* The dataset consists of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
* Features include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
* The goal is to train a machine learning model to accurately classify the flowers into their respective species.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
