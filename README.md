### TASK OVERVIEW

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and embarkation port. The model is built using Pythonâ€™s pandas, scikit-learn, and other essential libraries.

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python
This project focuses on predicting movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, cast, and more. Using a dataset from movie ratings, this project employs regression techniques to make accurate predictions. The task includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### 3. Iris Flower Classification
In this project, I classify iris flowers into different species based on the length and width of their petals and sepals. A simple and well-known classification problem, it uses the famous Iris dataset with algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and more.

### 4. Sales Prediction using Python
This project is aimed at predicting future sales based on advertising expenditures across various platforms like TV, Radio, and Newspapers. Using a regression approach, the model analyzes historical sales data to forecast future sales trends and optimize marketing strategies.
