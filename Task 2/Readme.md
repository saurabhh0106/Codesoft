### ðŸŽ¬ Movie Rating Prediction with Python
This project aims to predict movie ratings based on key features such as genre, director, and actors using regression techniques. By analyzing historical movie data, we explore how different factors influence ratings given by users or critics.

### ðŸš€ Key Features:
* Data Collection & Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw movie data.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and correlations in movie ratings.
* Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful insights from categorical and numerical data.
* Machine Learning Models: Implementing and evaluating regression models for accurate rating predictions.
* Model Performance & Insights: Fine-tuning models and interpreting feature importance.
